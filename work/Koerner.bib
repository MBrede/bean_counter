  abstract = {Automatic segmentation of key microstructural features in atomic-scale electron microscope images is critical to improved understanding of structure–property relationships in many important materials and chemical systems. However, the present paradigm involves time-intensive manual analysis that is inherently biased, error-prone, and unable to accommodate the large volumes of data produced by modern instrumentation. While more automated approaches have been proposed, many are not robust to a high variety of data, and do not generalize well to diverse microstructural features and material systems. Here, we present a flexible, semi-supervised few-shot machine learning approach for segmentation of scanning transmission electron microscopy images of three oxide material systems: (1) epitaxial heterostructures of SrTiO3/Ge, (2) La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 thin films, and (3) MoO3 nanoparticles. We demonstrate that the few-shot learning method is more robust against noise, more reconfigurable, and requires less data than conventional image analysis methods. This approach can enable rapid image classification and microstructural feature mapping needed for emerging high-throughput characterization and autonomous microscope platforms.},

To this purpose novel polycrystalline ceramic materials based on Cu and Gd co-doped BaCeO3 proton conductors exhibiting high proton conductivity have been prepared and characterized. The influence of copper oxide as a dopant on the microstructure and the electrical properties of BaCe0.9–xGd0.1CuxO3–δ (0≤x≤0.1) have been examined in detail. It is shown that the dependence of the electrical conductivity is correlated with the average oxide grain diameter variation in air at various temperatures. Moreover, it was found that the algorithmic segmentation evaluation results are in good agreement with the experimental ones, verifying the considerable contribution of the grain-boundary conductivity to the electrical transport of Cu and Gd co-doped BaCeO3 proton conductors.},

  abstract = {Several recent advances to the state of the art in image classification benchmarks have come from better configurations of existing techniques rather than novel approaches to feature learning. Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has been the job of humans because they can be very efficient in regimes where only a few trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and GPU processors make it possible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can find better results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neural networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the expected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufficiently efficient for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreliable for training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difficult DBN learning problems from [Larochelle et al., 2007] and find significantly better results than the best previously reported. This work contributes novel techniques for making response surface models P (y|x) in which many elements of hyper-parameter assignment (x) are known to be irrelevant given particular values of other elements.},

  abstract = {To achieve peak predictive performance, hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a crucial component of machine learning and its applications. Over the last years, the number of efficient algorithms and tools for HPO grew substantially. At the same time, the community is still lacking realistic, diverse, computationally cheap, and standardized benchmarks. This is especially the case for multi-fidelity HPO methods. To close this gap, we propose HPOBench, which includes 7 existing and 5 new benchmark families, with a total of more than 100 multi-fidelity benchmark problems. HPOBench allows to run this extendable set of multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks in a reproducible way by isolating and packaging the individual benchmarks in containers. It also provides surrogate and tabular benchmarks for computationally affordable yet statistically sound evaluations. To demonstrate HPOBench's broad compatibility with various optimization tools, as well as its usefulness, we conduct an exemplary large-scale study evaluating 13 optimizers from 6 optimization tools. We provide HPOBench here: https://github.com/automl/HPOBench.},

On the other hand, bandit-based configuration evaluation approaches based on random search lack guidance and do not converge to the best configurations as quickly. Here, we propose to combine the benefits of both Bayesian optimization and bandit-based methods, in order to achieve the best of both worlds: strong anytime performance and fast convergence to optimal configurations. We propose a new practical state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization method, which consistently outperforms both Bayesian optimization and Hyperband on a wide range of problem types, including high-dimensional toy functions, support vector machines, feed-forward neural networks, Bayesian neural networks, deep reinforcement learning, and convolutional neural networks. Our method is robust and versatile, while at the same time being conceptually simple and easy to implement.},

The accurate detection of epilepsy is essential to reduce the risk of seizure related complications. However the available automatic signal detection techniques give poor sensitivity and accuracy. In this work, an automatic signal classification method for detecting seizure from EEG signal is presented for obtaining good classification results. The proposed work improves the performance of detection using Variable Gaussian filter (VGF) with social spider algorithm (SSA) (SSA-VGF), Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) feature extraction method, K- Principal component analysis (K-PCA) based feature reduction and Fuzzy logic embedded RBF kernel based ELM algorithm (FRBFELM). The SSA-VGF method is used for removing noise artifacts from the given EEG signals. EWT is employed for feature extraction and the size of extracted features is reduced using K-PCA method. Finally the signals are classified as normal signals and epileptic signals using FRBFELM classifier. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by measuring the metrics; PSNR, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The value of performance metrics obtained for the proposed work is 98.48\%, 98.44\% and 98.51\%.},

  abstract = {A simple procedure for creating grain boundary maps from petrographic thin sections, termed the Lazy Grain Boundary (LGB) method, has been devised. It is based on a set of macro commands programmed for NIH Image, a public domain image processing software. The grain boundary detection is based on gradient filtering. The procedure makes use of multiple input images: sets of regular polarized micrographs or—where possible—orientation/misorientation images. On each image of a given input set, only the most significant grain boundaries are detected and by combining those, a single grain boundary map is obtained. Image models and criteria for grain boundary identification are discussed briefly. The principal aim of the LGB method is to facilitate the production of large grain boundary maps (containing several thousand cross-sectional areas) to provide statistically valid samples for grain size analysis. A section of Black Hills quartzite was used to test the LGB method. Five different input sets were prepared and used for automatic LGB analysis. One set was additionally used for an interactive analysis and for a manual tracing. From all seven grain boundary maps, the 2- and 3-D grain size distributions were calculated. The results are compared and the different image sets and procedures are rated for precision, over- and undersegmentation and speed of preparation.},

  abstract = {Microstructural characterization and analysis is the foundation of microstructural science, connecting materials structure to composition, process history, and properties. Microstructural quantification traditionally involves a human deciding what to measure and then devising a method for doing so. However, recent advances in computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML) offer new approaches for extracting information from microstructural images. This overview surveys CV methods for numerically encoding the visual information contained in a microstructural image using either feature-based representations or convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, which then provides input to supervised or unsupervised ML algorithms that find associations and trends in the high-dimensional image representation. CV/ML systems for microstructural characterization and analysis span the taxonomy of image analysis tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation.

There have been numerous endeavors to reproduce the human capability of perceptually classifying different textures using machine learning methods, but this is still very challenging owing to the need for a vast labeled image dataset. In this study, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning technique based on convolutional neural networks and a superpixel algorithm for the segmentation of a low-carbon steel microstructure without the need for labeled images. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated with optical microscopy images of steel microstructures having different patterns taken at different resolutions. In addition, several evaluation criteria for unsupervised segmentation results are investigated along with the hyperparameter optimization.},

  abstract = {A multitude of applications in engineering, ore processing, mineral exploration, and environmental science require grain recognition and the counting of minerals. Typically, this task is performed manually with the drawback of monopolizing both time and resources. Moreover, it requires highly trained personnel with a wealth of knowledge and equipment, such as scanning electron microscopes and optical microscopes. Advances in machine learning and deep learning make it possible to envision the automation of many complex tasks in various fields of science at an accuracy equal to human performance, thereby, avoiding placing human resources into tedious and repetitive tasks, improving time efficiency, and lowering costs. Here, we develop deep-learning algorithms to automate the recognition of minerals directly from the grains captured from optical microscopes. Building upon our previous work and applying state-of-the-art technology, we modify a superpixel segmentation method to prepare data for the deep-learning algorithms. We compare two residual network architectures (ResNet 1 and ResNet 2) for the classification and identification processes. We achieve a validation accuracy of 90.5\% using the ResNet 2 architecture with 47 layers. Our approach produces an effective application of deep learning to automate mineral recognition and counting from grains while also achieving a better recognition rate than reported thus far in the literature for this process and other well-known, deep-learning-based models, including AlexNet, GoogleNet, and LeNet.},

  abstract = {In the production process of aluminium alloy, we can evaluate the microstructure and characterization of alloy metals by using optical microscope and transmission electron microscope. Specifically, we could access the second phase distribution and grain of alloy surface by optical microscope, which are significant indications of alloy qualities and mechanical properties. In the actual industrial production process, the majority of meaningful information are extracted by manual counting. This kind of complicated statistics greatly increase the work of quality inspectors and researchers, which make them hard to concentrate on research of properties of alloy metal. Based on this, we proposed a deep learning method that utilizing U-Net to realize the accurate segmentation of the alloy matrix and the second phase in the metallographic image based on superpixels algorithm and transfer learning. Researchers can easily get some important information about distribution and proportion of the second phase to improve work efficiency. The final experiments indicate that the method proposed in this paper can effectively distinguish alloy matrix and second phase in metallographic image and achieve good results on accuracy, recall, precision and generalization.},

  abstract = {Identifying and counting individual mineral grains composing sand is an important component of many studies in environment, engineering, mineral exploration, ore processing and the foundation of geometallurgy. Typically, silt (32–128μm) and sand (128–1000μm) sized grains will be characterized under an optical microscope or a scanning electron microscope. In both cases, it is a tedious and costly process. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce an original computational approach in order to automate mineral grains recognition from numerical images obtained with a simple optical microscope. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the current computer vision based on machine learning algorithms is tested for the automated recognition of such mineral grains. In more details, this work uses the simple linear iterative clustering segmentation to generate superpixels and many of them allow isolating sand grains, which is not possible with classical segmentation methods. Also, the approach has been tested using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, CNNs did not give as good results as the superpixels method. The superpixels are also exploited to extract features related to a sand grain. These image characteristics form the raw dataset. Prior to proceed with the classification, a data cleaning stage is necessary to get a usable dataset for machine learning algorithms. In addition, we present a comparison of performances of several algorithms. The overall obtained results are approximately 90\% and demonstrate the concept of mineral recognition from a sample of sand grains provided by a numerical image.},

This method was used to accurately and automatically determine grain boundary positions and further assess the grain size distribution of monophasic ceramics, metals, and alloys. The only required sample preparation is polishing the cross section to a mirror-like finish. The SEraMic method is based on at least six backscattered electron scanning electron microscopy images of a unique region of interest with various tilt angles ranging from -5° to +5°, which emphasises the orientation contrasts of the grains. Because the orientation contrast varies with the incident beam angle on the sample, the set of images contains information related to all the grain boundaries. The SEraMic plugin automatically calculates and builds a segmented image of the grain boundaries from the set of tilted images. The SEraMic method was compared with classical thermal etching methods, and it was applied to determine the grain boundaries in various types of materials (oxides, phosphates, carbides, and alloys). The method remains easy to use and accurate when the average grain diameter is greater than or equal to 0.25 μm.},

While many classification methods have been proposed, there is no consensus on which methods are more suitable for a given dataset. As a consequence, it is important to comprehensively compare methods in many possible scenarios. In this context, we performed a systematic comparison of 9 well-known clustering methods available in the R language assuming normally distributed data. In order to account for the many possible variations of data, we considered artificial datasets with several tunable properties (number of classes, separation between classes, etc). In addition, we also evaluated the sensitivity of the clustering methods with regard to their parameters configuration. The results revealed that, when considering the default configurations of the adopted methods, the spectral approach tended to present particularly good performance. We also found that the default configuration of the adopted implementations was not always accurate. In these cases, a simple approach based on random selection of parameters values proved to be a good alternative to improve the performance. All in all, the reported approach provides subsidies guiding the choice of clustering algorithms.},

State-of-the-art imaging equipment such as serial block- face electron microscopes acquire gigabytes of data in a matter of hours. In order to make these amounts of data manageable, a more data-efficient representation is required. A popular approach for such data efficiency are superpixels which are designed to cluster homogeneous regions without crossing object boundaries. The use of superpixels as a pre-processing step has shown significant improvements in making computationally intensive computer vision analysis algorithms more tractable on large amounts of data. However, microscopy datasets in particular can be degraded by noise and most superpixel algorithms do not take this artifact into account. In this paper, we give a quantitative and qualitative comparison of superpixels generated on original and denoised images. We show that several advanced superpixel techniques are hampered by noise artifacts and require denoising and parameter tuning as a pre-processing step. The evaluation is performed on the Berkeley segmentation dataset as well as on fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy data.},

In order to decrease the computational costs of superpixel algorithms, we adopt a fast two-step framework. In the first clustering stage, the DBSCAN algorithm with color-similarity and geometric restrictions is used to rapidly cluster the pixels, and then, small clusters are merged into superpixels by their neighborhood through a distance measurement defined by color and spatial features in the second merging stage. A robust and simple distance function is defined for obtaining better superpixels in these two steps. The experimental results demonstrate that our real-time superpixel algorithm (50 frames/s) by the DBSCAN clustering outperforms the state-of-the-art superpixel segmentation methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel approach for solving the perceptual grouping problem in vision. Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We applied this approach to segmenting static images, as well as motion sequences, and found the results to be very encouraging.},

EDF statistics are easily calculated, and the tests require only one line of significance points for each situation. They are also shown to be competitive in terms of power.},

  abstract = {Superpixels group perceptually similar pixels to create visually meaningful entities while heavily reducing the number of primitives for subsequent processing steps. As of these properties, superpixel algorithms have received much attention since their naming in~2003 (Ren and Malik, 2003). By today, publicly available superpixel algorithms have turned into standard tools in low-level vision. As such, and due to their quick adoption in a wide range of applications, appropriate benchmarks are crucial for algorithm selection and comparison. Until now, the rapidly growing number of algorithms as well as varying experimental setups hindered the development of a unifying benchmark. We present a comprehensive evaluation of 28 state-of-the-art superpixel algorithms utilizing a benchmark focussing on fair comparison and designed to provide new insights relevant for applications. To this end, we explicitly discuss parameter optimization and the importance of strictly enforcing connectivity. Furthermore, by extending well-known metrics, we are able to summarize algorithm performance independent of the number of generated superpixels, thereby overcoming a major limitation of available benchmarks. Furthermore, we discuss runtime, robustness against noise, blur and affine transformations, implementation details as well as aspects of visual quality. Finally, we present an overall ranking of superpixel algorithms which redefines the state-of-the-art and enables researchers to easily select appropriate algorithms and the corresponding implementations which themselves are made publicly available as part of our benchmark at http://www.davidstutz.de/projects/superpixel-benchmark/.},

These algorithms are assessed using different evaluation metrics and datasets resulting in discrepancy in algorithm comparison. This calls for a benchmark to compare the state-of-the-arts methods and evaluate their pros and cons. We analyze benchmark metrics, datasets and built a superpixel benchmark. We evaluated and integrated top 15 superpixel algorithms, whose code are publicly available, into one code library and, provide a quantitative comparison of these algorithms. We find that some superpixel algorithms perform consistently better than others. Clustering based superpixel algorithms are more efficient than graph-based ones. Furthermore, we also introduced a novel metric to evaluate superpixel regularity, which is a property that superpixels desired. The evaluation results demonstrate the performance and limitations of state-of-the-art algorithms. Our evaluation and observations give deep insight about different algorithms and will help researchers to identify the more feasible superpixel segmentation methods for their different problems.},

The undersegmentation error is effectively limited in a controllable manner. Moreover, VCells is very efficient with core computational cost at O(K√nc·N) in which K, nc, and N are the number of iterations, superpixels, and pixels, respectively. Extensive qualitative discussions are provided, together with the high-quality segmentation results of VCells on a wide range of complex images.
